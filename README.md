# fcc-filemetadata
FreeCodeCamp's File metadata micro-service project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a JavaScript application that is functionally similar to [this application](https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it onto Heroku. The application itself is quite simple and asks the user for a file to upload and returns its filesize.
The description hinted at using the [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)  middleware for handling the multipart file upload, see also its [Github repository](https://github.com/expressjs/multer).
